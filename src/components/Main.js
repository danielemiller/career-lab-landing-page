                          At some point, every job seeker must ask themselves the ultimate question.
                          Targeted applications or resume blasts? No one wants to sit around waiting
                          to receive a response from a single employer. But the more you apply to new
                          roles and companies, the more difficult it can be to maintain an organized, 
                          targeted job search. Career Lab gives you the best of both worlds with secure 
                          cloud-storage of multiple versions of targeted career documents within an organized,
                          intuitive, user-friendly database for easy, reliable access.

                          for similar roles. You can then pull the components you want from your master
                          documents to create and store targeted versions of all the required documents
                          for the job applications in that project.
